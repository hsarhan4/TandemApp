Tandem Application 

Background:

COVID-19 has dramatically reshaped the way global education is delivered. 
Due to low level adoption of technologically aided models of learning. i.e Online Education,  Africa's education sector was severely impacted by Covid-19.
The shut down of countries in March 2020 resulted to school closures, this took place when online Education was yet properly installed.
This brings us to Internet accessibility which is a critical factor for online Education. From research Men had a higher access of 3%  as compared to women in developed countries and a significant difference of 11.1% in least developed nations.  

Problem Statement:
In what ways did Covid-19 affect education in African Nations?  
How effective was the transition to online learning in  different African countries?
Does online Education work in all African countries?
How can we facilitate equal education standards across low income and high-income countries?

Tand-Edu App: 

The Tand-Edu app provides a learning and knowledge sharing platform for students and teachers across developing and developed countries. The app  provides an opportunity for knowledge sharing on academic, socio-cultural and entertainment aspects, with an aim to breach the gab in the educational sector as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The app also provide opportunity for entertainment.

In conclusion, Covid-19 pandemic affected every aspect of the economy including family, agriculture, finance, and education as seen from our analysis. 
Remote learning has demonstated that we are all interconnected. Therefore, Multisectoral collaborations and individual efforts are necessary to breaching this gap.
